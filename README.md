# Module 5 - Data Visualization Challenge
This is my bootcamp assignment 5, Data Visualisation challenge.
This project uses the skills that I learnt as part of Module 5 to analyze and visualize data from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) study by Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications.

Pymaceuticals Folder: 
1. main.py --> Contains python pandas script for the SCC study analysis 
2. data folder --> Contains the csv file from which the data was acquired
